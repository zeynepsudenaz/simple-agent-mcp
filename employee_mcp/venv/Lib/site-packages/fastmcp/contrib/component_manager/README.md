# Component Manager ‚Äì Contrib Module for FastMCP

The **Component Manager** provides a unified API for enabling and disabling tools, resources, and prompts at runtime in a FastMCP server. This module is useful for dynamic control over which components are active, enabling advanced features like feature toggling, admin interfaces, or automation workflows.

---

## üîß Features

- Enable/disable **tools**, **resources**, and **prompts** via HTTP endpoints.
- Supports **local** and **mounted (server)** components.
- Customizable **API root path**.
- Optional **Auth scopes** for secured access.
- Fully integrates with FastMCP with minimal configuration.

---

## üì¶ Installation

This module is part of the `fastmcp.contrib` package. No separate installation is required if you're already using **FastMCP**.

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Setup

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.contrib.component_manager import set_up_component_manager

mcp = FastMCP(name="Component Manager", instructions="This is a test server with component manager.")
set_up_component_manager(server=mcp)
```

---

## üîó API Endpoints

All endpoints are registered at `/` by default, or under the custom path if one is provided.

### Tools

```http
POST /tools/{tool_name}/enable
POST /tools/{tool_name}/disable
```

### Resources

```http
POST /resources/{uri:path}/enable
POST /resources/{uri:path}/disable
```

 * Supports template URIs as well
```http
POST /resources/example://test/{id}/enable
POST /resources/example://test/{id}/disable
```

### Prompts

```http
POST /prompts/{prompt_name}/enable
POST /prompts/{prompt_name}/disable
```
---

#### üß™ Example Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Disabled tool: example_tool"
}

```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Custom Root Path

To mount the API under a different path:

```python
set_up_component_manager(server=mcp, path="/admin")
```

### Securing Endpoints with Auth Scopes

If your server uses authentication:

```python
mcp = FastMCP(name="Component Manager", instructions="This is a test server with component manager.", auth=auth)
set_up_component_manager(server=mcp, required_scopes=["write", "read"])
```

---

## üß™ Example: Enabling a Tool with Curl

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://localhost:8001/tools/example_tool/enable
```

---

## üß± Working with Mounted Servers

You can also combine different configurations when working with mounted servers ‚Äî for example, using different scopes:

```python
mcp = FastMCP(name="Component Manager", instructions="This is a test server with component manager.", auth=auth)
set_up_component_manager(server=mcp, required_scopes=["mcp:write"])

mounted = FastMCP(name="Component Manager", instructions="This is a test server with component manager.", auth=auth)
set_up_component_manager(server=mounted, required_scopes=["mounted:write"])

mcp.mount(server=mounted, prefix="mo")
```

This allows you to grant different levels of access:

```bash
# Accessing the main server gives you control over both local and mounted components
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://localhost:8001/tools/mo_example_tool/enable

# Accessing the mounted server gives you control only over its own components
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://localhost:8002/tools/example_tool/enable
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- `set_up_component_manager()` registers API routes for tools, resources, and prompts.
- The `ComponentService` class exposes async methods to enable/disable components.
- Each endpoint returns a success message in JSON or a 404 error if the component isn't found.

---

## üß© Extending

You can subclass `ComponentService` for custom behavior or mount its routes elsewhere as needed.
